* Low-level live coding
Interactive prototype for SuperCollider: https://supercollider.github.io/

- A video demo: https://youtu.be/AA78JewyU44

LHC stands for "Live hardware coding", as presented for the first time as a poster in the 1st Live Interfaces in 2012, in U. of Leeds, UK.  The initial commit of the software implementation can be found here: https://github.com/iani/SC/tree/master/Quarks/iz.projects/LHC


** Instructions
- Move the =lhc-classes= into the =Platform.userExtensionDir= folder (in MacOS =~/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions=)
- Recompile the class library: =thisProcess.recompile=
- Boot the server (=s.boot=) and run the code in the script: =lhc-tokens-demo.scd=
